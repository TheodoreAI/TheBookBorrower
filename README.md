*Brief description of the project and my particular contribution within the project:
- TheBookBorrower came about because I have a lot of books and I like to lend them to my friends and family but with time I lose track of who had what. Naturally, I decided to build a program that would keep track of my books. The timing was perfect because I was taking CS340 and TheBookBorrower became a project I got to work with another student. We built a database web application whose purpose was to keep track of books borrowed by friends, family, and other students. I contributed in 16 different branches on GitHub where I wrote code in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PostgreSQL. The high-level tasks I took care of were the Create and Delete (CRUD) aspects of the TheBookBorrower. 53% of the project is written in JavaScript, and the TheBookBorrower is compatible with two of the most popular relational database systems: PostgreSQL and MariaDB Express-handlebars was used as the main HTML templating engine. The project was deployed on the platform as a service Heroku. This is some of the best work I have done in my past projects written in JavaScript. I even got an A in CS340 thanks to this project. I am currently working on a user login templating project which I hope to integrate to this project to add a user interface to allow admin to login/logout/register capabilities. 

Scope of the project - high-level overview of the project complexity and time budgeted for completion. If the project is large and was worked on by several people, weâ€™d want to know what your specific contribution was.
-	TheBookBorrower was a 10-week project and the following are time-percentage estimates based on Git commit logs: 50% of my time was dedicated to writing JavaScript code to implement create and delete functionalities and debugging them. The creating and deleting routes were made to connect with the database. 25% of the time was spent on designing the user-interface. I built the add to database forms, their routes, and MySQL queries, as well as the home page. 10% of the time was spent meeting with my partner to plan ahead and provide updates on progress on my assigned responsibilities. 10% of the time was designing and writing some of the code for the database and making sure it worked both with MariaDB and PostgreSQL. I wrote queries to create and delete books and borrowers as well as the queries that would fill the database with the inputted information. 
And finally, 5% was spent safely deploying the entire project to be accessible by the general public. I made an application on Heroku added a PostgreSQL database to the app and figured out how to use the connectionString to allow TheBookBorrower connect to the database.
